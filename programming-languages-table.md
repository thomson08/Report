\*Note: Haskellâ€™s type class system provides a form of polymorphism that differs from traditional subtyping found in object-oriented languages.

\**Note: Java, C#, and C++ have limited type inference capabilities, such as the use of the `var` keyword in Java and C# or `auto` in C++.

- **Threads**: The language provides built-in support for concurrency using threads.
- **Async**: The language supports asynchronous programming for concurrency.
- **Actors**: The language uses the actor model for concurrency.
- **Goroutines**: The language supports lightweight threads called goroutines.
- **Green Threads**: The language uses green threads for concurrency.
