# Participation

Participation is activity by students that helps to improve the course. 

In total, there are 10 participation points that can be obtained through a combination of the following activties. Each of these activities is worth 2 points:

- Attending a Fowler School of Engineering Seminar.[^seminars]
- Attending office hours.
- Making an interesting contribution on the Discord server of this course.

To make it transparent how participation points are awarded, there must be some evidence of your contribution:

- If you attend an Engineering Seminar, write a discussion post on the Seminar channel of Discord (approx 200 words), summarizing the key content of the seminar (do not copy the abstract, it needs to be your own summary) and adding a question of your own. 
- If you attend office hours come prepared with an interesting question (about anything related to the course from a technical question to homework or the lectures to the ramifications of programming languages technology on the wider society). After the OH, write me an email summarizing briefly the key content of what we discussed.

This must be submitted **within 24 hours**.

Participation points for other remarkable contributions may be awarded.

[^seminars]: Additional seminars might be announced as well.
